  "storyP1": "Francis and Cherrie were first introduced to each other through a mutual friend, Christine, back in November of 2011 at Def Talent Jam in Gainesville, FL. Although this interaction may only have been a few brief seconds, they became connected via Facebook not too long after. A few months later, after getting Francis' phone number from Christine, Cherrie randomly sent Francis a text during St. Patty's Day weekend while they were both heading out to their respective college weekend festivities. A few back and forth texts throughout that night continued into the next few days.",
  "storyP2": "They both were able to meet a few weeks later in Tallahassee, as Cherrie was planning on visiting Christine. After a weekend of paddleboarding, partying, and awkward conversations, a connection was established. On April 29, 2012, Francis and Cherrie planned a trip to Walt Disney World in Orlando, FL as a date. At 9PM that night during the \"Happily Every After\" fireworks show at Magic Kingdom, Francis asked Cherrie to be his girlfriend and the rest is history."
