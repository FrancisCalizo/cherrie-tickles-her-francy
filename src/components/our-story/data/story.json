  "storyP1": "Francis and Cherrie were first introduced to each other through a mutual friend, Christine, back in November of 2011 at Def Talent Jam in Gainesville, FL. Although this interaction may only have been a few brief seconds, they became connected via Facebook not too long after. A few months later, after getting Francis' phone number from Christine, Cherrie randomly sent Francis a text during St. Patty's Day weekend while they were both heading out to their respective college weekend festivities. A few back and forth texts throughout that night continued into the next few days.",
  "storyP2": "They both were able to meet a few weeks later in Tallahassee, as Cherrie was planning on visiting Christine. After a weekend of paddleboarding, partying, and awkward conversations, a connection was established. On April 29, 2012, Francis and Cherrie planned a trip to Walt Disney World in Orlando, FL as a date. At 9PM that night during the \"Happily Every After\" fireworks show at Magic Kingdom, Francis asked Cherrie to be his girlfriend and the rest is history.",
  "francisBio": "\"The best thing about Francis is how thoughtful he is. He always considers me in his decisions and is aware of my emotions. He will surprise me with my favorite food or spontaneously go on an adventure with me. I admire how determined he is in his personal and professional life. Iâ€™m so excited to call him my husband and look forward to the many new chapters we will be writing in the years ahead.\"",
  "cherrieBio": "\"What I love most about Cherrie is how caring and selfless she is not only towards me, but to everyone around her. She is so compassionate and understanding in every situation, and is always a joy to be around. I'm able to genuinely be myself when I'm with her, which typically results in her realizing I'm even more of a weirdo than the day before.\""
